# Codeboard

Codeboard is a prototype of a platform that helps you to go from an idea to a ship in no time. It uses AI to do the boring stuff, but uses purpose-built models and provides different freedoms to them based on the task.

## Key Features

Codeboard has 4 key features, each one seamlessly integrated with the next.

### Scribbles

Jot down ideas on-the-go in an editor supporting markdown, drawings, and charts.

### Boards (Coming Soon)

Refine and develop your ideas with the help of specially designed AI (**not** chatbots) and NLP. Define processes with flowcharts that understand your idea, and define specifics like frameworks with extensive options. Use different data representations/charts depending on the type of information you are specifying, so you don't waste time ineffectively preserving ideas. Never forget specifics again.

### Jumpstarts (Coming Soon)

Get creating straight away with pre-configured dev environments ready just when you need them, with no need to wait for them to boot. Skip the boring stuff with boilerplate written by AI (once again, specially designed and not generalised).

### Prototypes (Coming Soon)

Tweak important features of your implementation and automatically create new versions that incorporate even more of your idea. Go from a rushed version 1 to a final ship in no time.

## Framework

Codeboard is currently being built on Vite + React. It will likely be a website for some time before desktop and mobile apps are published.
